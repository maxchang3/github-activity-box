</p>

---

This is a fork of [activity-box](https://github.com/JasonEtco/activity-box) with the following enhancements:

- Published to npm: Added a binary for seamless usage with `npx` or `pnpx`.
- Preprocess events following the rules below:
  - [x] Exclude closed unmerged pull requests and update snapshots accordingly.
  - [ ] Consolidate duplicate pull request events, retaining only the latest one.
- Extends allowed events in `Toolkit.run`.
- Update the dependencies, replace with some new ones, and remove unused ones.

## Setup

**activity-box** is a GitHub Action that is designed to work using the [`schedule`](https://developer.github.com/actions/managing-workflows/creating-and-cancelling-a-workflow/#scheduling-a-workflow) event.

### Prep work

1. Create a new public GitHub Gist (https://gist.github.com/)
2. [Create a token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with the `gist` scope and copy it. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` that comes with GitHub Actions cannot currently use the Gist API.

### Project setup

1. Create a `.github/workflows/activity-box.yml` file with a workflow like this:
   ```yml
   name: Activity Box
   on:
     workflow_dispatch:
     schedule:
       - cron: '*/10 * * * *'
   jobs:
     language-box:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout
           uses: actions/checkout@v4

         - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
           name: Install pnpm
           id: pnpm-install
           with:
             version: 10
             run_install: true

         - name: Setup node
           uses: actions/setup-node@v4
           with:
             node-version: 20
             cache: pnpm

         - name: Update
           run: pnpx github-activity-box@0
           env:
             GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
             GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
             GH_USERNAME: maxchang3
             GIST_ID: 123abc
   ```
2. [Create a secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) üîë by going to **GitHub repo > Settings > Secrets > New secret** with the following:
- Name: `GH_PAT`.
- Value: The token with the `gist` scope generated previously.

### Environment variables & secrets

- **GIST_ID:** The ID portion from your gist url `https://gist.github.com/matchai/`**`6d5f84419863089a167387da62dd7081`**.
- **GH_PAT:** The GitHub token generated above.
- **GH_USERNAME:** The username handle of the GitHub account.
